## About Visura

> **Note:** This repository contains the **design and specification** of the Visura system. It is currently under development and not yet available as a functional implementation.

**Visura** is a next-generation system designed to evolve from the **FVIP (Front View Image Processor)**. Its main goal is to provide **intelligent visual caching** and **adaptive post-processing** for the **Unreal Engine 5.6**.  
The system focuses on reducing GPU load by reusing cached fragments, while dynamically adjusting **filters and shadows** to ensure visual consistency across complex scenes.

Key aspects include:

- Adaptive spatial cache manager.  
- Progressive blending of cached fragments to avoid visual pop-ins.  
- Dynamic post-processing (exposure, tone, contrast, LUTs).  
- Automatic shadow calibration and adjustment.  
- Two operational profiles: **Quality** and **Performance**.  
- Monitoring and debugging tools for runtime analysis.

## Learning Visura

The project is in **design phase**, so documentation is focused on conceptual architecture, goals, and roadmap.  

Once implementation begins, integration guides for Unreal Engine and usage examples will be added.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but please note that the project is in **early design stage**.  

- Open [discussions](https://github.com/escolhendo/visura/discussions) for architectural ideas.  
- Use [issues](https://github.com/escolhendo/visura/issues) to report design questions or feature proposals.  
- Submit pull requests only for documentation, design improvements, or proofs of concept.  

Please follow the contribution guide (to be published soon).

## Security

If you discover a design flaw or potential security concern in the proposed architecture, please open a **private security advisory** instead of a public issue.  
(See [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) for reference.)
